## Analyst Journey (Since 2017)

## Analyst Journey (Since 2017)

*My research process identified a significant mispricing in the electricity stock at $7, a conviction strengthened as market panic drove the price even lower to $0.96. However, recognizing the inherent difficulty in acting decisively on research, I observed from the sidelines while those with greater risk tolerance and conviction realized returns exceeding 2500% as the stock rebounded to $25 within two months. This experience underscored the critical distinction between identifying an opportunity and successfully capitalizing on it.
